# Docker-First

This is my first try playing with docker. the app ask for a name, store it in the localStorage and expose the previous stored names.   

To run the app: clone this repository, open bash on the main cloned directory and type:

# docker compose up -d

open it on localhost:80

to close the app:

# docker compose down
